# Standard pattern used across all integration points:
from utils.achievements import check_achievements
check_achievements(username, context="specific_action", **additional_data)
```

### Context Values Implemented
- `"lesson_completed"` - Lesson progression tracking
- `"quiz_completed"` - Quiz performance with score data
- `"daily_mission_completed"` - Daily engagement tracking  
- `"user_login"` - Login streak and consistency tracking
- `"xp_awarded"` - XP progression with amount tracking
- `"degen_test_completed"` - Personality test completion
