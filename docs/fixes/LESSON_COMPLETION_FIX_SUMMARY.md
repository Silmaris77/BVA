# LESSON COMPLETION DISPLAY FIX SUMMARY

## Problem Identified
The lesson completion status was showing "Nieukończono" (Not Completed) instead of "Ukończono" (Completed) for completed lessons because of a data synchronization issue between session state and file-based user data.

## Root Cause
1. When a lesson is completed, `mark_lesson_as_completed()` updates both the file and `st.session_state.user_data`
2. However, the dashboard and other views were always loading data from the file using `load_user_data()` 
3. This created a potential mismatch if session state had newer data than what was immediately available from the file

## Solution Implemented
1. **Added `get_current_user_data()` function** in `data/users.py`:
   - Prioritizes session state data when available
   - Falls back to file data if session state is empty
   - Ensures the most current completion status is always displayed

2. **Updated key views** to use the new function:
   - `views/dashboard.py`: Updated `display_lesson_cards()` and `get_recommended_lessons()`
   - `views/lesson.py`: Updated lesson overview display
   - `views/skills_new.py`: Updated skill tree lesson display

## Files Modified
- `data/users.py`: Added `get_current_user_data()` function
- `views/dashboard.py`: Updated 3 functions to use current user data
- `views/lesson.py`: Updated lesson overview data loading
- `views/skills_new.py`: Updated user data loading

## Expected Result
✅ Completed lessons will now correctly show: **"✓ Ukończono"**
✅ Uncompleted lessons will show: **"○ Nieukończono"**
✅ Status updates immediately after lesson completion without needing page refresh
✅ All views (dashboard, lesson overview, skills) show consistent completion status

## Technical Details
The fix ensures that when `mark_lesson_as_completed()` updates `st.session_state.user_data`, all subsequent calls to display lesson cards will use this updated data instead of potentially stale file data.

The lesson_card component logic was already correct:
```python
{'✓ Ukończono' if completed else '○ Nieukończono'}
```

The issue was in the data source, not the display logic.
