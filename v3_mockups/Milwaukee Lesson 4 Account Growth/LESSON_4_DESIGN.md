## Card-by-Card Breakdown

### **Card 1: Video + Reflection (5 XP)**

**Type**: Video Introduction + Checkbox + Textarea

**Video Topic**: "From 100k to 500k: The Account Growth Mindset"
- **Duration**: 8 minutes
- **Speaker**: Milwaukee KAM (real success story)
- **Key Points**:
  1. **Single-threaded = High Risk**: One contact at Procurement = vulnerable (if they leave, you lose account)
  2. **Multi-threading**: 5+ contacts across departments = resilient partnership
  3. **Growth ≠ More Products**: Growth = solving more problems across more departments
  4. **Strategic vs Transactional**: Transactional = price wars. Strategic = business outcomes.
  5. **Timeline**: 100k → 500k takes 18-24 months (not overnight, build trust first)

**Reflection Question**: "Describe your largest account today. How many stakeholders do you have relationships with? What departments are you NOT yet serving? What would 3× growth look like?"

**XP Award**: 5 XP for watching video + completing reflection

**Insight Box**: "Top 1% KAMs don't SELL more. They become INDISPENSABLE. How? Solve problems for PM (downtime), CFO (ROI), Safety (compliance), Procurement (TCO), Maintenance (reliability), Training (onboarding). One tool sale → company-wide partnership."

### **Card 2: Growth Framework - 4 Strategies (0 XP - Educational)**

**Type**: Visual Framework Diagram + Comparison Table

**Visual**: 2×2 Matrix
- **X-axis**: Existing Products → New Products
- **Y-axis**: Existing Departments → New Departments

**4 Quadrants**:

1. **Penetration** (Existing Products → Existing Departments)
   - **Strategy**: Increase usage density within current users
   - **Example**: PM uses M18 drills on Line 1 → expand to Lines 2, 3, 4
   - **Tactics**: Pilot programs, demo loans, side-by-side comparisons
   - **Risk**: Low (known buyer, known product)
   - **Growth Potential**: 20-50% (limited by department size)

2. **Expansion** (New Products → Existing Departments)
   - **Strategy**: Cross-sell complementary products to current buyers
   - **Example**: PM has drills → add impact wrenches, grinders, batteries
   - **Tactics**: Bundle discounts, ONE-KEY integration, compatibility stories
   - **Risk**: Low-Medium (known buyer, new product education needed)
   - **Growth Potential**: 50-150% (depends on product portfolio fit)

3. **Development** (Existing Products → New Departments)
   - **Strategy**: Sell current products to new departments (same company)
   - **Example**: Production has drills → sell to Maintenance, Quality, R&D
   - **Tactics**: Internal referrals, cross-department demos, success story sharing
   - **Risk**: Medium (new buyer, known product, need new relationship)
   - **Growth Potential**: 100-300% (multiply by number of departments)

4. **Diversification** (New Products → New Departments)
   - **Strategy**: Introduce new solutions to new stakeholders
   - **Example**: Sell PPE (heated gear, gloves) to Safety dept (new buyer, new category)
   - **Tactics**: Executive sponsorship, pilot programs, ROI business case
   - **Risk**: High (new buyer + new product = double education)
   - **Growth Potential**: 200-500% (highest upside, hardest execution)

**Comparison Table** (4 rows × 5 columns):
| Strategy | Products | Buyers | Risk | Growth % | Best For |
|----------|----------|--------|------|----------|----------|
| Penetration | Existing | Existing | Low | 20-50% | Quick wins, build trust |
| Expansion | New | Existing | Low-Med | 50-150% | Deepen wallet share |
| Development | Existing | New | Medium | 100-300% | Leverage success stories |
| Diversification | New | New | High | 200-500% | Strategic accounts only |

**Insight**: "Start with Penetration/Expansion (low risk, build credibility). Then Development (leverage advocates). Diversification last (requires executive sponsor). Don't jump to high-risk before earning trust."

**Interactive Element**: None (pure educational card, no XP - foundational knowledge)

- **Title**: (text input)
- **Department**: (dropdown - linked to Section 1)
- **Influence Level**: (High/Medium/Low - radio buttons)
- **Relationship Status**: (Champion/Supportive/Neutral/Skeptical/Blocker - radio)
- **Current Products Used**: (checkboxes: Drills, Impact, Grinders, Saws, Batteries, None)
- **Pain Points**: (textarea - what problems do they have?)
- **Last Contact Date**: (date picker)

**Section 3: Visual Org Chart** (Auto-generated from inputs)
- Displays stakeholders in tree structure
- Color-coded by Relationship Status:
  - Green = Champion
  - Light Green = Supportive
  - Gray = Neutral
  - Orange = Skeptical
  - Red = Blocker
- Size based on Influence Level (High = large circle, Low = small)
- Lines show reporting structure

**Section 4: Opportunity Analysis** (Auto-calculated)
- **Departments Covered**: X/11 (% coverage)
- **Champions**: X stakeholders (need minimum 2 for strategic account)
- **Blockers**: X stakeholders (need mitigation plan)
- **White Space**: Departments with ZERO contacts → growth opportunity
- **Single-Threaded Risk**: Departments with only 1 contact → vulnerable

**Section 5: Next Actions** (System recommends based on data)
Example outputs:
- "⚠️ WARNING: Only 1 contact in Production (Marek). If he leaves, you lose account. Add 2+ contacts."
- "💡 OPPORTUNITY: Safety department has ZERO contacts. They need PPE (heated gear, gloves). Ask Marek for intro."
- "✅ STRENGTH: 3 champions (Marek PM, Zofia CFO, Anna Safety). Leverage them for executive sponsorship."

**Validation & XP**:
- Minimum 5 stakeholders mapped → Enable "Save Map" button
- Save → Award 15 XP (only once)
- LocalStorage: Save entire account map for retrieval

**Insight**: "Single-threading = deal risk. Multi-threading = partnership resilience. Top KAMs have 7-12 contacts per strategic account across 4+ departments. Map shows white space (growth opportunity) and red flags (churn risk)."

### **Card 4: Cross-Sell Calculator (15 XP)**

**Type**: Interactive Product Fit Analyzer + Revenue Estimator

**Purpose**: Systematically identify which Milwaukee products fit client's existing operations

**Structure**:

**Section 1: Current State Assessment** (Checkboxes)
Client currently uses Milwaukee for:
- ☐ Drilling/Fastening (M18 Drills, Impact Drivers)
- ☐ Cutting (Sawzalls, Circular Saws, Band Saws)
- ☐ Grinding (M18 Grinders, Cut-Off Tools)
- ☐ Lighting (Work Lights, Headlamps)
- ☐ Storage (Packout System)
- ☐ PPE (Heated Gear, Gloves, Safety Glasses)
- ☐ Measuring (Lasers, Levels)
- ☐ Other: _______

**Section 2: Operations Profile** (Checkboxes - select all that apply)
Client has these operations:
- ☐ Metalworking (welding, fabrication)
- ☐ Electrical work (conduit, panels, wiring)
- ☐ HVAC installation/maintenance
- ☐ Plumbing
- ☐ Automotive assembly/repair
- ☐ Carpentry/woodworking
- ☐ Maintenance (facility, equipment)
- ☐ Demolition/renovation
- ☐ Outdoor work (winter conditions)
- ☐ Confined spaces
- ☐ Height work (scaffolding, ladders)

**Section 3: Pain Points** (Checkboxes)
Current challenges:
- ☐ Downtime due to tool failures
- ☐ Battery compatibility chaos (multiple platforms)
- ☐ Lost tools (no tracking system)
- ☐ Worker discomfort (cold weather, vibration)
- ☐ Safety incidents (hand injuries, eye injuries)
- ☐ Slow task completion (underpowered tools)
- ☐ Training gaps (new workers struggle)
- ☐ Storage inefficiency (tools scattered, lost)

**Section 4: Cross-Sell Recommendations** (Auto-generated based on selections)

Algorithm logic:
- If "Metalworking" + "Grinding" NOT selected → Recommend M18 Grinders (5", 6", Cut-Off)
- If "Outdoor work" + "PPE Heated Gear" NOT selected → Recommend Heated Jackets, Gloves, Hoodies
- If "Electrical" + "Measuring" NOT selected → Recommend Laser Levels, Voltage Detectors
- If "Battery chaos" pain → Recommend ONE-KEY system (tool tracking + battery management)
- If "Lost tools" pain → Recommend Packout System + ONE-KEY tracking
- If "Storage inefficiency" → Recommend Packout modular storage

**Output: Recommendation Cards** (3-column grid)
Each card shows:
- **Product Image** (icon/illustration)
- **Product Name**: e.g., "M18 5" Grinder Kit"
- **Why It Fits**: "You do metalworking but don't have grinders. This cuts metal prep time 40%."
- **Value Proposition**: "Saves 2h/day on grinding tasks = 500h/year = 25k PLN labor savings"
- **Estimated Cost**: 3,500 PLN (per unit)
- **Estimated Value**: 25,000 PLN/year (TCO)
- **Ratio**: 7.1× value/cost
- **Quantity Needed**: Slider (1-50 units) → Updates total
- **Add to Proposal** button

**Section 5: Proposal Summary** (Dynamic total)
- **Products Selected**: X items
- **Total Investment**: XX,XXX PLN
- **Total Estimated Value (Year 1)**: XXX,XXX PLN
- **Value/Cost Ratio**: X.X×
- **Generate Proposal** button → Creates formatted email/PDF

**Validation & XP**:
- Select minimum 3 recommendations + set quantities → Enable "Save Proposal"
- Save → Award 15 XP
- LocalStorage: Save proposal for retrieval

**Insight**: "Cross-sell is NOT about pushing products. It's about solving UNSOLVED problems. Client uses drills but not grinders? They're grinding with manual files (slow, expensive). Your job: connect product to pain."

---

### **Card 5: Upsell Scenarios - Practice (20 XP)**

**Type**: Multiple Choice Scenarios (6 scenarios, A/B/C/D options each)

**Purpose**: Train KAMs to recognize upsell triggers and execute value-based upsell conversations

**Scenario 1: Volume Upsell**
**Situation**: "Client bought 10 M18 drill kits last year (20k PLN). Production Manager mentions they're hiring 15 new workers for second shift expansion."

**Options**:
- A) Offer 20% discount on next 15 kits if they order today (upsell through discount)
- B) Wait for them to call you when they need tools (reactive approach)
- C) Propose: '15 workers × 1 kit each = 15 kits (30k). But bulk order 20 kits → save 10% + free Packout storage (value 5k). Total investment 52k, you save 11k vs buying piecemeal.'
- D) Send email: 'Heard you're hiring. Let me know if you need tools.' (passive)

**Correct**: C  
**Feedback (Correct)**: "✅ Perfect! You identified trigger (hiring), calculated need (15 workers), proposed volume incentive (bulk discount + value-add), and quantified savings (11k). Proactive + value-driven."  
**Feedback (Incorrect)**: "❌ Reactive approach or discount-led upsell misses the point. Upsell trigger = business change (hiring, expansion, new line). Your job: anticipate need + propose solution BEFORE they ask. Volume discount is fine IF bundled with value (Packout, training, ONE-KEY)."

**Scenario 2: Product Upgrade**
**Situation**: "Client uses M18 standard batteries (5.0Ah). Maintenance Manager complains: 'We're changing batteries 3x per shift. Kills productivity.'"

**Options**:
- A) Recommend they buy more 5.0Ah batteries (more of the same)
- B) Propose M18 High Output 12.0Ah batteries: '2× runtime, only 60% more cost. You'll cut battery swaps from 3× to 1× per shift. Saves 30 min/worker/day = 250h/month = 12k PLN labor savings. Batteries cost 8k. ROI in 21 days.'
- C) Suggest they reduce usage to save battery life (counterproductive)
- D) Ignore complaint (they'll figure it out)

**Correct**: B  
**Feedback (Correct)**: "✅ Excellent! You recognized pain (battery swaps), proposed UPGRADE (not more quantity), calculated ROI (12k savings vs 8k cost), and showed payback (21 days). This is consultative upselling."  
**Feedback (Incorrect)**: "❌ More 5.0Ah batteries doesn't solve ROOT CAUSE (low runtime). Upgrade to High Output 12.0Ah = fewer swaps, more productivity. Don't sell MORE. Sell BETTER."

**Scenario 3: Ecosystem Lock-In**
**Situation**: "Client has 30 M18 tools but uses manual storage (tools scattered, 2h/week wasted searching). CFO asks: 'How do we reduce tool loss?'"

**Options**:
- A) Recommend tool tracking spreadsheet (free solution)
- B) Propose Packout system + ONE-KEY: 'Packout modular storage (15k PLN) organizes all 30 tools. ONE-KEY (app + tags, 5k PLN) tracks every tool via Bluetooth. Stop wasting 2h/week searching (100h/year = 5k PLN labor). Total 20k investment, 5k annual savings + zero tool loss (currently lose 3k/year in missing tools). ROI: 10k savings Year 1.'
- C) Sell them more tools to replace lost ones (band-aid solution)
- D) Say 'Not our problem, talk to IT' (dismissive)

**Correct**: B  
**Feedback (Correct)**: "✅ Perfect ecosystem upsell! You tied storage (Packout) + tracking (ONE-KEY) to TWO pains (wasted time searching + tool loss). Quantified both (5k labor + 3k losses). This is how you lock in accounts - solve adjacent problems."  
**Feedback (Incorrect)**: "❌ Spreadsheets or more tools don't solve SYSTEM problem (disorganization + no tracking). Packout + ONE-KEY = ecosystem lock-in. Once they're on your platform, switching cost skyrockets. This is strategic upselling."

**Scenario 4: Service Upgrade**
**Situation**: "Client has 50 tools, 3-year standard warranty expiring in 6 months. PM: 'When warranty ends, we'll fix tools ourselves to save money.'"

**Options**:
- A) Let warranty expire (they made their decision)
- B) Offer 20% discount on warranty renewal (price-driven)
- C) Propose extended 5-year warranty + preventive maintenance program: 'DIY repairs cost 8k/year (labor + parts + downtime). Our 5-year extended (6k total) includes preventive maintenance (we inspect quarterly, catch issues early, zero downtime). You save 34k over 5 years (40k DIY cost - 6k warranty). Plus, tools last 8 years instead of 5 (replacement cost deferred).'
- D) Recommend they buy spare tools (expensive)

**Correct**: C  
**Feedback (Correct)**: "✅ Brilliant! You reframed warranty from COST (6k) to INVESTMENT (34k savings + extended tool life). Preventive maintenance = proactive (catch issues before failure). This is outcome-based upselling, not product-based."  
**Feedback (Incorrect)**: "❌ Letting it expire or discounting misses the strategic play. Warranty renewal = recurring revenue opportunity. But you need to sell OUTCOMES (zero downtime, predictable costs, longer tool life), not just 'extended coverage.'"

**Scenario 5: Training Upsell**
**Situation**: "New client bought 25 tools (50k PLN). Safety Manager: 'Workers don't use tools correctly. We had 2 hand injuries last month from improper grip.'"

**Options**:
- A) Send user manuals via email (low effort)
- B) Recommend safety gloves (product-only solution)
- C) Propose on-site training program: '4-hour session for 25 workers (3k PLN). We train proper grip, tool selection, safety protocols, battery management. Injuries drop 80% (industry data). Your worker's comp insurance drops 5k/year (actuarial benefit). Training pays for itself in 7 months + saves lives.'
- D) Blame workers (not our fault)

**Correct**: C  
**Feedback (Correct)**: "✅ Perfect! You sold TRAINING as risk mitigation (injuries) + cost savings (insurance). This positions you as PARTNER (we care about safety), not just vendor (here's tools, good luck). Training creates stickiness - workers trained on Milwaukee tools prefer Milwaukee tools."  
**Feedback (Incorrect)**: "❌ Manuals or gloves don't solve ROOT CAUSE (lack of training). On-site training = upsell opportunity + relationship deepening. You're in their facility, meeting workers, building multi-threading. Strategic move."

**Scenario 6: Premium Tier Upsell**
**Situation**: "Client uses M18 Fuel drills (mid-tier). Foreman: 'We drill 500 holes/day in stainless steel. Drills overheat by hour 6, workers take breaks waiting for cool-down.'"

**Options**:
- A) Recommend they drill slower (reduces productivity)
- B) Suggest buying more drills so workers can rotate (expensive, doesn't solve problem)
- C) Propose M18 Fuel Surge drills (premium tier): 'Surge hydraulic technology = zero overheating, 50% faster in stainless (industry test). Your 500 holes take 6h now, would take 4h with Surge. Saves 2h/day = 500h/year = 25k PLN labor. Surge drills cost 18k (6 units). ROI in 8.6 months.'
- D) Say 'Overheating is normal' (dismissive)

**Correct**: C  
**Feedback (Correct)**: "✅ Masterful! You identified performance gap (overheating, slow speed), proposed PREMIUM solution (Surge technology), calculated productivity gain (500h/year), and showed ROI (8.6 months). This is how you sell premium products - tie to BUSINESS OUTCOMES, not features."  
**Feedback (Incorrect)**: "❌ More drills or drilling slower = band-aid solutions. Premium tier upsell works when you show PERFORMANCE GAP between current tool and premium tool. Surge = 50% faster + zero overheating. That's 25k/year value. Worth 18k investment."

**Scoring**:
- 6/6 correct = Master (20 XP)
- 4-5 correct = Solid (20 XP)
- 2-3 correct = Need Practice (10 XP)
- 0-1 correct = Revisit Content (5 XP)

**XP Award**: Based on score (minimum 5 XP, max 20 XP)

**Insight**: "Upsell triggers: Volume increase (hiring, expansion), Pain point (battery swaps, tool loss), Warranty expiration, Performance gap (overheating, slow speed), Safety issues (injuries). Your job: ANTICIPATE these triggers, PROPOSE solutions BEFORE client asks. Reactive = commodity. Proactive = partner."

### **Card 6: 12-Month Growth Plan Builder (15 XP)**

**Type**: Interactive Roadmap Template + Milestone Tracker

**Purpose**: Create concrete, time-based account growth strategy

**Structure**:

**Section 1: Account Goal** (Inputs)
- **Current Annual Revenue**: _______ PLN (e.g., 100,000)
- **Target Revenue (12 months)**: _______ PLN (e.g., 300,000)
- **Growth Target**: Auto-calculated (e.g., 200% growth, +200k PLN)

**Section 2: Growth Strategy Mix** (Checkboxes + Sliders)
Based on Card 2 framework, allocate % of growth to each strategy:
- **Penetration** (Existing Products → Existing Depts): ___% (slider 0-100%)
- **Expansion** (New Products → Existing Depts): ___% (slider 0-100%)
- **Development** (Existing Products → New Depts): ___% (slider 0-100%)
- **Diversification** (New Products → New Depts): ___% (slider 0-100%)
- **Total**: Must = 100% (validation check)

Example:
- Penetration: 20% (40k PLN) - Expand drills to Lines 2-4
- Expansion: 30% (60k PLN) - Add grinders, impact wrenches
- Development: 40% (80k PLN) - Sell to Maintenance, Safety depts
- Diversification: 10% (20k PLN) - PPE to Safety dept (high risk, small %)

**Section 3: Quarterly Milestones** (4 quarters, dynamic input fields)

**Q1 (Months 1-3)**: Build Foundation
- **Revenue Target**: ______ PLN (auto-calculated from strategy mix)
- **Key Activities**: (textarea)
  - Example: "Pilot grinders on Line 2 (Penetration), Demo impact wrenches to PM (Expansion)"
- **Stakeholders to Engage**: (textarea)
  - Example: "Marek (PM), Anna (Maintenance Manager), Tomasz (Safety)"
- **Success Metrics**: (textarea)
  - Example: "2 new stakeholder relationships, 1 pilot closed, 25k revenue"

**Q2 (Months 4-6)**: Expand Footprint
- (Same input structure as Q1)
- Focus shifts to Development (new departments)

**Q3 (Months 7-9)**: Accelerate Growth
- (Same input structure)
- Focus on scaling successful pilots

**Q4 (Months 10-12)**: Lock-In & Renew
- (Same input structure)
- Focus on QBR, executive sponsorship, contract renewal

**Section 4: Risk Mitigation Plan** (Checkboxes + Actions)
Identify potential risks:
- ☐ Key contact leaves company → Action: Build 2+ backups per department
- ☐ Competitor undercuts price → Action: Lock in multi-year contract with value-add
- ☐ Budget cuts → Action: Tie purchases to ROI (show savings, not cost)
- ☐ Merger/acquisition → Action: Engage C-level, position as strategic partner
- ☐ Quality issue → Action: Proactive warranty, quarterly maintenance reviews

**Section 5: Roadmap Visual** (Auto-generated timeline)
- Displays 12-month timeline with quarterly milestones
- Color-coded by strategy type (Penetration = blue, Expansion = green, etc.)
- Progress bars show % of target achieved (updates if user inputs actual results)

**Validation & XP**:
- Complete all 4 quarterly plans + risk mitigation (minimum 3 risks) → Enable "Save Plan"
- Save → Award 15 XP
- LocalStorage: Save entire 12-month plan

**Downloadable Output**: "Export Plan" button → Generates formatted Word/PDF with:
- Account overview
- Growth target
- Strategy mix breakdown
- Quarterly milestones (Gantt chart style)
- Risk mitigation table

**Insight**: "100k → 300k doesn't happen by accident. It happens by PLAN. Q1 = build trust (pilots, demos). Q2 = expand departments (Development strategy). Q3 = scale what works (Penetration + Expansion). Q4 = lock-in (QBR, executive sponsorship, renewals). Top KAMs review this plan monthly with their manager."

### **Card 7: Executive Sponsorship - C-Level Champions (15 XP)**

**Type**: Interactive Guide + Email Template Builder

**Purpose**: Teach KAMs how to secure C-level advocates who accelerate growth

**Why It Matters** (Intro Section):
- **Single-threaded accounts = vulnerable**: If your only contact (Procurement) leaves, you lose account.
- **C-level sponsors = insurance**: CEO, CFO, COO backing you = procurement can't kill deal.
- **Growth accelerator**: C-level approval unlocks budgets across departments (not just one silo).
- **Competitive moat**: Competitor can't easily displace you if CEO is your champion.

**Section 1: Identify Your Target Executive** (Checkboxes + Info)

Who to target first:
- ☐ **CFO** - If you have strong ROI story (TCO savings, downtime reduction, labor efficiency)
  - **Best Approach**: QBR with financial data (savings, ROI, payback period)
  - **Pain Points**: Budget predictability, cost control, risk mitigation
- ☐ **COO** - If you solve operational problems (productivity, quality, uptime)
  - **Best Approach**: Operational metrics (cycle time, defect rates, OEE)
  - **Pain Points**: Production efficiency, supply chain stability, capacity utilization
- ☐ **VP Safety/EHS** - If you reduce injuries or improve compliance
  - **Best Approach**: Safety incident data, compliance audit results
  - **Pain Points**: Injury rates, OSHA fines, worker's comp costs
- ☐ **CTO/VP Engineering** - If you drive innovation or digital transformation
  - **Best Approach**: Technology roadmap, ONE-KEY IoT integration, data analytics
  - **Pain Points**: Legacy systems, skill gaps, competitive differentiation

**Section 2: Build Your Business Case** (Input Form)

**Executive**: (Dropdown - linked to Section 1 selection, e.g., CFO)

**Current State** (What's broken?):
- **Metric**: (text input, e.g., "Downtime: 15h/month")
- **Cost Impact**: (text input, e.g., "75k PLN/year lost revenue")
- **Root Cause**: (text input, e.g., "Tool failures, battery swaps")

**Proposed Solution**:
- **Milwaukee Investment**: (text input, e.g., "120k PLN (M18 Fuel + High Output batteries)")
- **Expected Outcome**: (text input, e.g., "Reduce downtime to 5h/month")
- **Financial Impact**: (text input, e.g., "Save 50k PLN/year")

**ROI Calculation** (Auto-generated):
- **Annual Savings**: (from Financial Impact, e.g., 50k PLN)
- **Investment**: (from Milwaukee Investment, e.g., 120k PLN)
- **Payback Period**: Investment ÷ Annual Savings = X years (e.g., 2.4 years)
- **3-Year ROI**: (Savings × 3) - Investment = Net Gain (e.g., 150k - 120k = +30k PLN)

**Section 3: Email Template Generator** (Live Preview)

**Template Options** (Dropdown):
1. CFO Email (ROI-focused)
2. COO Email (Operations-focused)
3. VP Safety Email (Compliance-focused)
4. CTO Email (Innovation-focused)

**CFO Email Template** (Dynamic placeholders):

```
Subject: [COMPANY] - Proposal to reduce downtime costs by {{SAVINGS}} PLN/year

Dear {{CFO_NAME}},

I've been working with {{PM_NAME}} ({{PM_TITLE}}) on improving tool reliability in {{DEPARTMENT}}. We've identified a significant cost opportunity:

CURRENT STATE:
• {{CURRENT_METRIC}} (e.g., 15h/month downtime)
• Cost impact: {{COST_IMPACT}} PLN/year
• Root cause: {{ROOT_CAUSE}}

PROPOSED SOLUTION:
• Investment: {{INVESTMENT}} PLN (Milwaukee M18 Fuel platform)
• Expected outcome: {{EXPECTED_OUTCOME}}
• Annual savings: {{SAVINGS}} PLN/year
• Payback: {{PAYBACK}} years
• 3-year net gain: {{NET_GAIN}} PLN

{{PM_NAME}} is supportive and willing to pilot this on Line 3 for 8 weeks. If we hit target (reduce downtime to 5h/month), we'd scale to Lines 1, 2, 4.

Would you be open to a 20-minute call next week to review the business case?

Best regards,
{{YOUR_NAME}}
Milwaukee Key Account Manager
```

**Section 4: Meeting Prep Checklist** (Interactive checklist)

Before exec meeting:
- ☐ Validate all numbers with department manager (PM/Maintenance/Safety)
- ☐ Prepare 1-page executive brief (problem, solution, ROI, timeline)
- ☐ Rehearse 3-minute pitch (execs are busy, get to point fast)
- ☐ Anticipate objections (budget, timing, vendor lock-in)
- ☐ Bring advocate (PM/Manager who supports you)
- ☐ Schedule 20-30 min max (respect their time)

During meeting:
- ☐ Lead with PROBLEM (not product): "You're losing 75k/year to downtime"
- ☐ Show DATA (metrics, not opinions): "Line 3 pilot reduced downtime 60%"
- ☐ Propose PILOT (low-risk): "8-week trial, if it doesn't work, full refund"
- ☐ Get COMMITMENT (not just 'sounds interesting'): "Can we schedule follow-up in 6 weeks?"

**Section 5: Follow-Up Plan** (Timeline builder)

**Week 1**: Send thank-you email + exec brief recap
**Week 4**: Share pilot results (even if partial data)
**Week 8**: Full QBR (Quarterly Business Review) - see Card 8
**Quarterly**: Ongoing exec touchpoints (quarterly emails with ROI updates)

**Validation & XP**:
- Complete business case (all fields filled) + email template + meeting checklist → Enable "Save Plan"
- Save → Award 15 XP

**Insight**: "C-level execs don't care about drills. They care about OUTCOMES: revenue, costs, risks, compliance. Your job: translate PRODUCTS (M18 Fuel) into BUSINESS LANGUAGE (50k/year savings, 2.4yr payback). One exec champion = access to entire company. PM gets you Line 3. CFO gets you Lines 1-2-3-4 + Maintenance + R&D."

### **Card 8: QBR (Quarterly Business Review) Template (15 XP)**

**Type**: Interactive Presentation Builder + Data Visualization

**Purpose**: Create data-driven quarterly reviews that prove value and unlock expansion

**Why QBRs Matter**:
- **Prove ROI**: Show you delivered what you promised (downtime reduction, cost savings)
- **Build credibility**: Data-driven review positions you as strategic partner, not vendor
- **Unlock budget**: CFO sees results → approves expansion to other departments
- **Renewal insurance**: Client sees value every 90 days → renewal is automatic
- **Growth trigger**: QBR surfaces NEW problems → new sales opportunities

**QBR Structure** (6 slides):

**Slide 1: Executive Summary**

**Input Fields**:
- **Account Name**: (text, e.g., "Automotive Tier 1 Sp. z o.o.")
- **Review Period**: (dropdown, e.g., "Q1 2026: Jan-Mar")
- **Total Investment YTD**: (number, e.g., 200,000 PLN)
- **Total Value Delivered YTD**: (number, e.g., 285,000 PLN)

**Slide 2: Key Metrics Dashboard** (Visual - 3 metric cards)

**Metric 1: Downtime Reduction**
- **Baseline** (before Milwaukee): (input, e.g., 15h/month)
- **Current** (after Milwaukee): (input, e.g., 6h/month)
- **Improvement**: Auto-calc (e.g., -60%, 9h saved/month)
- **Value**: Auto-calc (9h × 500 PLN/h × 3 months = 13,500 PLN saved)

**Metric 2: Safety Incidents**
- **Baseline**: (input, e.g., 8 hand injuries Q4 2025)
- **Current**: (input, e.g., 4 hand injuries Q1 2026)
- **Improvement**: Auto-calc (e.g., -50%)
- **Value**: Auto-calc (4 injuries × 8k PLN/incident (worker's comp) = 32,000 PLN saved)

**Metric 3: Productivity Gain**
- **Baseline**: (input, e.g., 100 units/day production)
- **Current**: (input, e.g., 125 units/day)
- **Improvement**: Auto-calc (e.g., +25%)
- **Value**: Auto-calc (25 units × 200 PLN margin × 60 days = 300,000 PLN revenue gain)

**Total Value Delivered**: Sum of all 3 metrics (e.g., 345,500 PLN)

**Slide 3: Adoption & Usage** (Visual - Progress bars)

**Tool Distribution**:
- **M18 Drills**: 30 units deployed, 28 active (93% usage rate)
- **M18 Impact Wrenches**: 15 units deployed, 14 active (93%)
- **M18 Grinders**: 10 units deployed, 8 active (80% - investigate why 2 idle)
- **High Output Batteries**: 50 units deployed, 48 active (96%)

**ONE-KEY Tracking** (if applicable):
- **Tools Tracked**: 55/55 (100%)
- **Average Daily Usage**: 6.2h per tool
- **Maintenance Alerts**: 3 tools flagged for service (proactive)
- **Lost Tools**: 0 (vs 3 lost in Q4 2025 without ONE-KEY)

**Interpretation**:
"93%+ usage rate = high adoption. Workers PREFER Milwaukee tools (vs old Bosch). 2 idle grinders on Line 4 → investigate (training gap? wrong spec?)."

---

**Slide 4: Challenges & Actions Taken** (Transparency builds trust)

**Challenge 1**: (textarea, e.g., "Battery runtime complaints on Line 2 (night shift)")
**Action Taken**: (textarea, e.g., "Upgraded to High Output 12.0Ah batteries (Week 6)")
**Outcome**: (textarea, e.g., "Complaints dropped to zero, night shift productivity +15%")

**Challenge 2**: (optional textarea)
**Action Taken**: (optional textarea)
**Outcome**: (optional textarea)

**Insight**: "Showing problems (and fixes) proves you're PARTNER, not just vendor. Vendors hide issues. Partners solve them."

---

**Slide 5: Next Quarter Growth Opportunities** (Strategic expansion)

**Opportunity 1: Expand to Maintenance Department**
- **Problem**: Maintenance uses competitor tools, 12h/month downtime on repair jobs
- **Solution**: 10 M18 Impact Wrenches + 5 Grinders (35k PLN investment)
- **Expected Value**: Reduce maintenance downtime to 5h/month (save 7h × 500 PLN × 3 months = 10,500 PLN/quarter)
- **Payback**: 3.3 quarters
- **Champion**: Anna (Maintenance Manager, already supportive from pilot demo)

**Opportunity 2: Safety Department PPE**
- **Problem**: Winter outdoor work, workers complain of cold hands (productivity drops 20%)
- **Solution**: 25 Heated Jackets + 25 Heated Gloves (18k PLN investment)
- **Expected Value**: Productivity recovery 20% on outdoor tasks (15 workers × 4h/day × 60 days × 200 PLN/h × 20% = 144k PLN)
- **Payback**: 1.5 months
- **Champion**: Tomasz (Safety Manager, cares about worker comfort + compliance)

**Total Q2 Expansion Potential**: 53k PLN investment → 154,500 PLN value (291% ROI)

---

**Slide 6: Renewal & Next Steps**

**Contract Status**:
- **Current Contract**: 200k PLN (expires Dec 2026)
- **Renewal Proposal**: 350k PLN annual (2-year contract)
  - **Breakdown**: Production (200k), Maintenance (100k), Safety (50k)
- **Benefits of 2-Year Contract**:
  - Price lock (no inflation risk)
  - Priority support (24h SLA)
  - Quarterly QBRs (proactive partnership)
  - ONE-KEY enterprise license (unlimited users)

**Next Steps**:
- ☐ Week 1: PM approves Maintenance expansion (35k)
- ☐ Week 4: Safety Manager approves PPE pilot (18k)
- ☐ Week 8: CFO reviews renewal proposal (350k × 2 years)
- ☐ Week 12: Q2 QBR scheduled (June 2026)

---

**Section 6: Export QBR Presentation** (Button)
- Generates PowerPoint or PDF with all 6 slides
- Professional Milwaukee branding
- Charts/graphs auto-generated from input data

**Validation & XP**:
- Complete Slides 1-6 (minimum: Executive Summary + 2 metrics + 1 opportunity) → Enable "Save QBR"
- Save → Award 15 XP

**Insight**: "QBRs are NOT product updates. They're BUSINESS REVIEWS. Show: (1) ROI delivered, (2) Problems solved, (3) Next opportunities. CFO sees 42% ROI in Q1 → approves 350k expansion in Q2. No QBR = 'out of sight, out of mind' → competitor displaces you."

### **Card 9: Risk Management - Churn Prevention (20 XP)**

**Type**: Warning Signs Quiz + Mitigation Playbook

**Purpose**: Teach KAMs to detect early churn signals and execute retention strategies

**Section 1: Warning Signs Assessment** (Checklist - user selects what they observe)

Which of these are happening in your account? (Check all that apply)

- ☐ **Reduced responsiveness**: Key contact (PM, Procurement) takes 3+ days to respond (used to respond same day)
- ☐ **Budget scrutiny**: CFO asking for cost breakdowns they never asked for before
- ☐ **Competitor mentions**: "We're evaluating Bosch/DeWalt as backup supplier"
- ☐ **Stakeholder turnover**: Your champion (PM, Safety Manager) left company or changed roles
- ☐ **Meeting cancellations**: Quarterly reviews rescheduled 2+ times or skipped
- ☐ **Volume decline**: Orders dropped 20%+ vs last quarter (no clear explanation)
- ☐ **Quality complaints**: Sudden increase in warranty claims or "tool doesn't work" feedback
- ☐ **Contract delays**: Renewal discussion pushed from Q1 to Q2 to Q3 (avoiding commitment)
- ☐ **Invoice disputes**: Procurement questioning line items they never questioned before
- ☐ **No new projects**: Client launching new production line but didn't consult you for tools

**Risk Score** (Auto-calculated):
- 0-2 checked: **Low Risk** (green) - "Account is healthy, maintain current engagement"
- 3-4 checked: **Medium Risk** (yellow) - "Warning signs present, take action within 2 weeks"
- 5-6 checked: **High Risk** (orange) - "Significant churn risk, executive intervention needed within 1 week"
- 7+ checked: **Critical Risk** (red) - "Account in danger, emergency meeting with C-level within 3 days"

---

**Section 2: 5 Churn Scenarios + Mitigation Playbooks**

**Scenario 1: The Silent Drift**
**Warning Signs**: Reduced responsiveness, meeting cancellations, no new projects
**Root Cause**: Client perceives you as "vendor" not "partner" (transactional relationship, no strategic value)

**Mitigation Playbook**:
1. **Immediate Action** (Week 1):
   - Schedule in-person meeting with key contact (PM/Procurement): "I noticed we haven't connected recently. Is everything OK?"
   - Conduct mini-QBR: Show ROI delivered over past 6 months (even if informal)
   - Ask: "What problems are you facing that I might not know about?"

2. **Strategic Action** (Weeks 2-4):
   - Engage C-level (CFO/COO): Send exec brief with business impact (ROI, cost savings)
   - Propose pilot for NEW problem (not just selling more of same): "I heard you're launching Line 5. Let's pilot ONE-KEY tracking to prevent tool loss."
   - Multi-thread: Meet with 2-3 NEW stakeholders (Maintenance, Safety, Training) to diversify relationships

3. **Validation**:
   - ☐ Meeting held within 7 days?
   - ☐ C-level engaged within 14 days?
   - ☐ New pilot/project proposed within 21 days?
   - **Success Metric**: Response time back to <1 day, meeting frequency back to bi-weekly

---

**Scenario 2: The Price War**
**Warning Signs**: Budget scrutiny, competitor mentions, invoice disputes
**Root Cause**: Competitor offered lower price, client questioning your value (you failed to prove ROI)

**Mitigation Playbook**:
1. **DO NOT**:
   - ❌ Match competitor price immediately (signals weakness, kills margin)
   - ❌ Badmouth competitor (unprofessional, makes you look desperate)
   - ❌ Give discount without justification (trains client to expect discounts)

2. **DO THIS** (Week 1):
   - **Ask for specifics**: "Can you share the competitor proposal so I can compare apples-to-apples?"
     - Often competitor quote is basic (no batteries, no warranty, no support) while yours is full package
   - **Show TCO comparison**: Build side-by-side table (upfront cost vs 3-year total cost)
     - Example: Bosch 80k upfront, Milwaukee 100k upfront. But Bosch TCO = 150k (high downtime), Milwaukee TCO = 110k (low downtime). You're 40k CHEAPER over 3 years.
   - **Offer value-add (not discount)**: "I can't match 80k, but I can add 5-year warranty (8k value) + quarterly maintenance (6k value) at 100k price. Total value 114k for 100k cost."

3. **Strategic Action** (Weeks 2-4):
   - **Pilot challenge**: "Let's test both. Bosch on Line 1, Milwaukee on Line 2 for 8 weeks. Whichever has lower downtime wins the contract. Fair?"
   - **Lock-in contract**: If they agree to stay, propose 2-year contract with price lock (prevents future price wars)

4. **Validation**:
   - ☐ TCO analysis presented within 3 days?
   - ☐ Pilot or value-add proposed within 7 days?
   - **Success Metric**: Client agrees to pilot OR accepts value-add proposal (without discount >5%)

---

**Scenario 3: The Champion Exodus**
**Warning Signs**: Stakeholder turnover (your champion left), no new projects (new PM doesn't know you)
**Root Cause**: Single-threaded account (only 1 relationship), when that person leaves, you lose access

**Mitigation Playbook**:
1. **Immediate Action** (Week 1):
   - **Reach out to departing champion** (if possible): "Congrats on new role! Before you go, can you intro me to your replacement?"
   - **Meet new stakeholder within 7 days**: Don't wait for them to call you. Book meeting: "Hi, I'm [Name], Milwaukee KAM. I worked with [Old PM] on tool reliability. I'd love to learn about your priorities."
   - **Bring proof**: Show new PM the results you delivered (downtime reduction, cost savings) so they see your value

2. **Strategic Action** (Weeks 2-4):
   - **Multi-thread aggressively**: Meet with 4-5 OTHER stakeholders (Maintenance, Safety, Procurement, CFO) so you're not dependent on 1 person
   - **Offer pilot to new PM**: "Let's do 4-week pilot on your biggest pain point. If it doesn't work, no cost."
   - **Executive sponsor backup**: If new PM is hostile, escalate to CFO/COO (your exec sponsor from Card 7)

3. **Validation**:
   - ☐ Met new stakeholder within 7 days?
   - ☐ 3+ new stakeholder relationships built within 30 days?
   - **Success Metric**: Contract renewed despite champion turnover (proves multi-threading worked)

---

**Scenario 4: The Quality Crisis**
**Warning Signs**: Quality complaints, warranty claims spike, "tool doesn't work" feedback
**Root Cause**: Product failure OR user error OR unrealistic expectations (client expected miracle, got normal tool)

**Mitigation Playbook**:
1. **Immediate Action** (Day 1-3):
   - **Acknowledge issue FAST**: "I heard about the grinder failures on Line 3. I'm escalating to Milwaukee engineering today."
   - **Visit site in-person**: Don't handle via email. Go to facility, inspect tools, talk to workers.
   - **Root cause analysis**: Is it product defect? User error? Wrong application? Environmental factor (extreme temps, abrasive materials)?

2. **Corrective Action** (Week 1):
   - **If product defect**: Replace ALL defective units within 48h (free), offer extended warranty (goodwill gesture)
   - **If user error**: Provide on-site training (free 4h session), create user guides, blame yourself ("We should've trained better")
   - **If wrong application**: Recommend correct tool (e.g., they used M18 standard for heavy-duty job, need M18 Fuel High Torque)

3. **Strategic Action** (Weeks 2-4):
   - **Preventive maintenance program**: Offer quarterly tool inspections (catch issues before failure)
   - **ONE-KEY monitoring**: Track tool usage (overheating, overload) to predict failures
   - **SLA commitment**: "We guarantee <4h response time for warranty claims"

4. **Validation**:
   - ☐ On-site visit within 3 days?
   - ☐ Root cause identified + corrective action within 7 days?
   - ☐ Preventive program proposed within 14 days?
   - **Success Metric**: Warranty claims drop to baseline within 60 days, NPS score recovers

---

**Scenario 5: The Merger/Acquisition**
**Warning Signs**: Contract delays, budget scrutiny, stakeholder turnover (new management team from acquiring company)
**Root Cause**: New ownership = new procurement policies, new vendor review, potential consolidation (they might have existing Milwaukee or competitor relationships)

**Mitigation Playbook**:
1. **Intelligence Gathering** (Week 1):
   - **Research acquirer**: Do they use Milwaukee elsewhere? Bosch? DeWalt? (LinkedIn, press releases, industry contacts)
   - **Identify new decision-makers**: Who's the new CPO (Chief Procurement Officer)? New CFO? New COO?
   - **Talk to internal allies**: Ask your champions (PM, Safety) what they're hearing ("Are new owners changing tool suppliers?")

2. **Strategic Positioning** (Weeks 2-4):
   - **If acquirer uses Milwaukee elsewhere**: Leverage! "Your parent company uses Milwaukee at 12 facilities. We can consolidate your account into their enterprise contract (volume discount, simplified billing)."
   - **If acquirer uses competitor**: Differentiate. "I know parent company uses Bosch. But your facility has unique needs (stainless steel drilling, outdoor work). Our tools have 60% lower downtime (pilot data). Can we present to new CPO?"
   - **Executive sponsor critical**: Get CFO/COO to advocate to new parent company: "Milwaukee saved us 150k/year. Don't switch."

3. **Lock-In Tactics**:
   - **Multi-year contract**: Propose 3-year deal BEFORE acquisition closes (grandfathered in)
   - **Integration plan**: Offer to help parent company standardize on Milwaukee across all facilities (you become enterprise partner, not just site vendor)

4. **Validation**:
   - ☐ New decision-makers identified within 7 days?
   - ☐ Meeting with new CPO/CFO within 21 days?
   - ☐ Enterprise integration proposal within 30 days?
   - **Success Metric**: Contract survives M&A transition (not renegotiated down or cancelled)

---

**Section 3: Retention ROI Calculator** (Auto-generated)

**Input**:
- **Current Account Value**: ______ PLN/year (e.g., 200,000)
- **Cost to Acquire New Account**: ______ PLN (industry avg: 15-20% of annual value, e.g., 35,000)
- **Cost to Retain Existing Account**: ______ PLN (e.g., 5,000 - QBRs, pilots, training)

**Output**:
- **Retention Savings**: Acquire cost - Retain cost = Savings (e.g., 35k - 5k = 30,000 PLN saved)
- **ROI of Retention**: (Savings / Retain cost) × 100% (e.g., 600% ROI on retention efforts)

**Insight**: "It costs 5-7× MORE to acquire new account than retain existing one. Spending 5k on QBRs, pilots, training to save 200k account = 4,000% ROI. Churn prevention is HIGHEST ROI activity for KAMs."

---

**Scoring & XP**:
- User completes risk assessment + selects 1 mitigation playbook + validates retention ROI → Award 20 XP

**Insight**: "Churn doesn't happen overnight. It starts with SMALL signals (slow responses, meeting cancellations). Top KAMs catch it early (Week 1-2) and act. Average KAMs notice when contract isn't renewed (too late). Your job: Monitor health WEEKLY, act on yellow flags IMMEDIATELY."
